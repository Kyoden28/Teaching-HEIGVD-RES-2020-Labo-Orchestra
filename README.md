# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**. 
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound       |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`  |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`     |
| `flute`    | `trulu`     |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`   |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum` |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```

When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
|          | ![Orchestra_diagramm](.\images\Orchestra_diagramm.png)       |
| Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**?         |
|          | Each musician running container, each second while it's running. |
| Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
|          | Auditor is listening for musician's UDP datagrams. Then, it updates its list of active musicians |
| Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams?         |
|          | Payload should be built with at least instrument's sound and and UUID, a unique identifier automatically generated at the creation of the datagram. |
| Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
|          | We need a map to associate an instrument and a specific sound for a musician and a map to associate a sound and a specific instrument for an auditor. We also need a list of frequently updated active musicians for the auditor. |


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
|          | By using `JSON.stringify(object)`                            |
| Question | What is **npm**?                                             |
|          | The official Node.js Packet Manager used to simplify the installing, updating, configuring and deleting tools for JavaScript programming |
| Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag? |
|          | npm install is used to install dependencies in local node_modules directory. --save is used to add dependencies in the `.json` package. |
| Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?        |
|          | We can search for tools that we need (like UUID) and their documentation. |
| Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
|          | We can use the UUID package which has a `v4()` to generate an ID |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
|          | With `setInterval(callbackm millisecond,[args])`             |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?               |
|          | Firstly, we have to create a socket with dgram package. Then, we can use send() function with the specified socket to send an UDP datagram, in which we set the message, the length, the port and the IP address. |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
|          | With the `process.argv` array which contains the arguments.  |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image



| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?         |
|          | We need a Dockerfile in which we specify the building configuration. Then we use the docker build command to build the image of the Docker. For example : `docker build -t res/auditor` |
| Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile? |
|          | It can be used to execute a command at the start of the container. For example : `ENTRYPOINT ["node", "auditor.js"]` |
| Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**? |
|          | By using the command docker run. For example : `docker run res/musician trumpet` |
| Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?        |
|          | With `docker ps`                                             |
| Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?               |
|          | We can use docker stop which stops a running container after sending it first a `SIGTERM` and a `SIGKILL` signals or we can user a docker kill which directly send a `SIGKILL` signal. |
| Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams? |
|          | We can check it with the Docker Desktop interface or by capturing the network traffic with wireshark. |


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
|          | By using the `bind()` method from `dgram.socket`             |
| Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**? |
|          | We can use the `Map` to pair the UUID and a value. A good example would be the UUID + instrument pair we used in this project. |
| Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting? |
|          | There's a lot of numeric date (/zone) formats and `Moment.js` standardize the use of them which is really practical |
| Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?          |
|          | When a musician has not send anything for more than 5 seconds, we remove it from the `musicians` list of the Auditor. |
| Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?       |
|          | By using the `net` package                                   |


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #        | Topic                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
|          | We tried telnet connections on Auditor while it was running and also launched the validation script `validate.sh` |


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
